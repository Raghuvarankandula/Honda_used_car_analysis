# Honda_used_car_analysis
I have analyzed Honda's top 10 used car models and their prices based on different parameters such as fuel type and suspension types.
Using Python programming, I have managed null values, duplicates, and outliers to ensure reliable data. I have also created sub-DataFrames to analyze different parameters and used interactive visualizations to provide deeper insights.
Through this analysis, I have identified the top models from petrol and diesel fuel types with automatic and manual suspension types. Studying the price ranges with these parameters has also provided valuable insights into market trends and customer preferences.
The results of this analysis can help users choose the best Honda used car options. So, if you want to know more about Honda's used car selling trends, check out my latest project!

Important Findings:

✅ When the model year gets newer, prices do increases

✅ The price drops as the number of kilometers increases.
